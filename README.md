# Smart-City-Data-Dashboard

This project is a part of "AT71.05 â€“ Information Systems Development and Management" course in 2022-January semester.

The purpose of the project is to build a data report dashboard platform for cities based on the data retrieved from open data portals. The system can be used to build data dashboards related to a city such as crime statistics, PM2.5 statistics, number of patients in the area for a given time period and more. The data shown in the dashboard will be taken from an open data portal hosted by CKAN software (ckan.org) via CKAN API. The user generated dashboard will be shared via a dynamic URL, and the dashboard can be used by embedding the URL in a webpage. The final system design will be used by users who live in the cities and benefit them based on existing open data from various open data sources.
